# Study-of-Forecasting-Models-in-the-Indian-Pharmaceutical-Industry
## Project Overview
This project investigates the forecasting models used by the Indian pharmaceutical industry. The primary goal is to analyze and evaluate forecasting techniques applied to monthly sales data, providing insights into their performance and suitability for managing production and inventory in this sector.

## Literature Review
Survey of previous studies on forecasting methods such as:
- Moving Average
- Single Exponential Smoothing
- Holt-Winters’ Smoothing
- Linear Regression

## Methodology
- Analysis conducted using Python.
- Forecasting models applied:
    - Moving Average
    - Simple Exponential Smoothing
    - Holt-Winters’ Smoothing
    - Linear Regression
- Evaluation metrics:
    - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
    - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Results
- Performance comparison of models across two categories of medicines:
    - M01AB: Anti-inflammatory products
    - R06: Antihistamines
- Results indicate that the Moving Average technique provides the best accuracy for erratic and seasonal data.

## Conclusion
- Recommendations for choosing forecasting models based on data patterns.
- Limitations and potential for combining methods for improved accuracy.
